To-Do List - Full Stack Project #2

https://to-do-project-2.herokuapp.com/
https://deehefka.github.io/To-Do-List-Project-2-Client-Repo/

This project will be an attempt to create a front and back end that creates to-do lists for the user. This would be a valuable application for anyone needing to keep track of their life.

Unsolved problems:

I think I got everything working...?
I'd like to add more to this eventually - maybe a calendar or way to add a 'completed date'

Technologies used:

Ruby on Rails, Postgresql, Heroku, Git Hub
